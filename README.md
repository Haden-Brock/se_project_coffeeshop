# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- Embedded videos

## Plan on improving the project

-Make the page responsive to different screen sizes (phone etc). 
-Make the nav bar static to the top of the page so that it stays when you scroll. 
-Modernize the form (text spacing, rounding of input fields).
